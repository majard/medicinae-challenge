# medicinae-challenge
An app written in php/Laravel to store information about health insurance companies and clinics. Also includes a simple RESTful api. You must be logged in to view/update the resources or create a new one. The restful api expects a api_token field in your request, that is returned to the client after the login. The fields for registration (at /api/register) are email, name, password and password confirmation.
